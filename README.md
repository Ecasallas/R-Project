# R-Project
The perverse procedure: Normality test and if rejected use Wilcoxon; otherwise use a t-test.

Objective: through a series of simulations we aim to demonstrate why using a normality test such as Shapiro-Wilk before choosing between a parametric or non-parametric test is not useful to the understanding and studying of data.
The code associated with this project was run using R (version 4.5.1).
